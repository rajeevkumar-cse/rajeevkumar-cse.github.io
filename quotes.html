<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Self</b>: A few make a System for millions. However, a few envious individuals who control this system destroy those few who make/reform it. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore</b>: If no one answers your call, Walk alone. If no one speaks to you, If everyone turns away, If everyone is afraid to speak, Then with an open heart, Without hesitation, Speak alone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Whistleblower</b>: One equipped with Maths, Science, and Engineering can solve practical problems in ways the system people do not try. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Academic Leadership</b>: He served as a Senator in IITs Kharagpur/Kanpur and BITS, a member of the Court and Academic 
  Council in JNU, and several other academic bodies, e.g., Board of Studies, Statutory Comm. of Institutes/Universities. 
  He worked for reforms in curriculum, academic structure, regulations, and ordinances. He mostly worked as a crisis 
  handler with out-of-box solutions for complex problems.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ernest Hemingway</b>: ... A few men for the right cause brave the disrespect of their fellowmen, censor of their colleagues and ignorance of society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential quality of those seeking to change a world which yields out painfully to change. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Unsung Hero</b>: A Leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done and his aim is fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves: Lao Tzu, a Chinese poet & philosopher.</p>
